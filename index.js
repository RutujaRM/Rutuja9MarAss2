Consumers often compile a shopping list of groceries to purchase on the next visit to the grocery store (a grocery list). The shopping list was known 2000 years B.C. in ancient Mesopotamia.[1][unreliable source?] There are surviving examples of Roman[2] and Biblical[3] shopping lists.<p> The shopping list itself may be simply a scrap piece of paper or something more elaborate. There are pads with magnets for keeping an incremental list available at the home, typically on the refrigerator, but any magnetic clip with scraps of paper can be used to achieve the same result. There is even a specific device that dispenses a strip of paper from a roll for use in a shopping list. Some shopping carts come with a small clipboard to fit shopping lists on.</p>";

We’re probably up and caffeinating 90min beforehand. It isn’t a phrase that you should use lightly when summoning a creative.</p><h3>Intake</h3><p>Introduce the new project, requirements, and expected delivery window to team leads.</p><h3>Unpack</h3><p>After the design lead(s) process the intake it is unpacked to the creative team in an actionable way, typically using a creative brief. This will include a summary of the intake alongside research findings and a design challenge articulation.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>An expanded version of the processed intake will be placed into a project brief. The goal is for the lead designer to restate and reframe the intake in an actionable way that everyone can agree on while setting expectations for what will be delivered. Once the agreement is made any shifts in the strategy will affect the delivery timeline.</p><h3>Ideation</h3><p>This is a creative call where we brainstorm potential solutions to a design challenge.</p>";

When the original object enters the atmosphere, various factors such as friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting star or falling star; astronomers call the brightest examples. Once it settles on the larger body's surface, the meteor becomes a meteorite. Meteorites vary greatly in size. For geologists, a bolide is a meteorite large enough to create an impact crater.</p><p>Meteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere and impact the Earth are called meteorite falls. All others are known as meteorite finds. As of August 2018, there were about 1,412 witnessed falls that have specimens in the world's collections.[3] As of July 2021, there are more than 65,780 well-documented meteorite finds.</p><p>Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites that are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites that are largely composed of ferronickel; and stony-iron meteorites that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. Meteorites smaller than 2 mm are classified as micrometeorites. Extraterrestrial meteorites have been found on the Moon and on Mars.</p>";
